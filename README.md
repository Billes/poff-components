## Commit information

We are using GitHub workflows to automate storybook building and publishing of new releases.
As you commit changes to your project, write them down into the [Unreleased] section in CHANGELOG.md. Once a new release is created, unreleased changes are automatically moved under the new version heading.
Our workflow requires that you stick with the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) convention.

##### Type of changes:

- **Added**: for new features
- **Changed**: for changes in existing functionality
- **Deprecated**: for soon-to-be removed features
- **Removed**: for now removed features
- **Fixed**: for any bug fixes
- **Security**: in case of vulnerabilities.
